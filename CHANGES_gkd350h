2020.02, Released Feb 8th, 2020

	The very first public homebrew buildroot release for gkd350h 

	
	Notes
	0.
	This buildroot is for building rootfs for gkd350g CFW only so far.

	1.
	gmenu2x is updated, but this version is *not* fully support for those 
	particular features of gkd350h. such as CPU performance, LCD backlight 
	level and sound vol settings inside the settings menu. Requiring some 
	work here.

	2.
	gmenunx(esoteric version) and retroarch are included and fully ready 
	to be compiled in the full packages. (but, these two packages won't 
	be install into the rootfs as those setting files are not yet been 
	made and copied to the right place. Some work is necessary for post-build 
	stuff, and retroarch 1.84 has issues for resolution changing for 
	gkd350h. need some tweaks for this).

	3.
	GCC 5.4 is the default toolchain compiler now. (would be generated during 
	the building of buildroot) You still can switch back to 4.9.1 if you 
	still need it.

	4. 
	probably still something i forgot to mention. :)
